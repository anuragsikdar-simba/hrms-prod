- **PDF Generation**: pdf-lib
- **Language**: TypeScript

## Getting Started

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure your Supabase project credentials.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or for LAN phone access:
   npm run dev:network
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Deployment (Cloudflare Workers)

Live at **https://junnon-hrms.august-projects.workers.dev**.

Deployed via the [OpenNext Cloudflare adapter](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare) (`@opennextjs/cloudflare@1.15.0`,
pinned -- newer versions require Next.js 15+, this app is on 14.2.35). Config lives in `wrangler.jsonc` and
`open-next.config.ts`.

To redeploy after code changes, from a machine with `wrangler` authenticated (`npx wrangler login`, or
`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` env var set):

```bash
npm install
npm run cf:deploy
```

`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env vars are baked in at build time from `.env.local` -- update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` there to match
the live URL before deploying. The server-side `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is a Worker secret, set once via:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
```

Worker name is `junnon-hrms` (`wrangler.jsonc`). The `workers.dev` subdomain (`august-projects`) is an
account-level setting, changeable once more via Cloudflare dashboard -> Workers & Pages -> "Your subdomain" ->
Change -- doing so breaks the URL above and requires a redeploy.

Private & Proprietary.
